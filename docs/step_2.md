# Video 02 – First Naive Job Execution

## Branch

video-02-basic-job

## Goal

Introduce the idea of a job without abstraction or async.

## What We Build

- `Job` struct
- `Process()` method
- Hardcoded handler

## Concepts

- Structs
- Methods
- Pointer receivers
- Basic test

## Key Teaching Point

This implementation is intentionally bad.

## What’s Wrong (Call Out Explicitly)

- Hardcoded logic
- No flexibility
- No error handling
- No persistence

## Message to Viewer

“We start simple so refactoring makes sense later.”
