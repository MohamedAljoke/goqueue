# Video 06 – Organizing Code Like a Real Project

## Branch

video-06-project-structure

## Goal

Avoid the “one giant file” problem.

## What We Build

- `internal/` folder
- Separate packages:
  - job
  - storage
- Public API layer

## Concepts

- Go package boundaries
- `internal` visibility rules
- Separation of concerns

## Teaching Note

“Good structure prevents future pain.”
